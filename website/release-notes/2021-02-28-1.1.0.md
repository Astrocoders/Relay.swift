## Added

- Support for [declarative mutation directives](/Relay.swift/docs/knowledge-base/declarative-mutation-directives), preventing the need to write [updater functions](/Relay.swift/docs/knowledge-base/updater-functions) for several common mutation patterns. Using these requires at least version 10.1.0 of `relay-compiler`.
- Support for client-local schema extensions, which allow you to use Relay to store and manage data that only exists in your app, not on your server.
