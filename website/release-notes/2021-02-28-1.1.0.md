## Added

- Support for [Declarative mutation directives](../Knowledge%20Base%20472752960b6b4afe854e4b3a814bbb54/Declarative%20mutation%20directives%2040338446da3141f5a83235db51277750.md), preventing the need to write [Updater functions](../Knowledge%20Base%20472752960b6b4afe854e4b3a814bbb54/Updater%20functions%20b03f4d7d45d044e393b01545c4746079.md) for several common mutation patterns. Using these requires at least version 10.1.0 of `relay-compiler`.
- Support for client-local schema extensions, which allow you to use Relay to store and manage data that only exists in your app, not on your server.
